    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
      Tooling Hero was built to solve real-world challenges machinists face every day.
      From organizing tool libraries to generating consistent, error-proof IDs and descriptions,
      our mission is to bring clarity, speed, and confidence to modern manufacturing workflows.

      Our first major product, <strong>DANG (Description and Naming Generator)</strong>, helps shops
      implement smart standards in their tooling systems. Whether you're a small job shop or
      an enterprise-scale operation, Tooling Hero gives you the power to standardize and scale.
